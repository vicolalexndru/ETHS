	        	<h3>How long does an average home / kitchen extension take to build?</h3>
	        	<p>We estimate on average a home extension can take between 10 – 12 weeks to build.</p>
	        </div>
	        <div class="col-md-6 question block">
	        	<h3>How quickly can you start to build an extension on my property?</h3>
	        	<p>Our lead in times are currently 2 – 4 weeks assuming that you have plans, structural calculations and party wall notices in place (if required).  Please contact us on +44 20 7099 8689 for a more accurate estimate of start dates.</p>

	       <div class="col-md-6 question block">
	          <h3>What is a party wall agreement and do I need one for my extension?</h3>
	          <p>A party wall agreement is required if your home has a wall that is connected to another property on either side.  Each neighbour will have to be informed of the proposed works using a party wall notice form at least two calendar monthsbefore the intended start of the build.  The party wall agreement is there to protect you and your neighbour from issues that might arise due to work done on the party wall. It draws up an agreement between you and you neighbour on what needs to happen if there is a problem. By law your neighbour can insist you have one before the work starts.   This process is handled by clients directly, however if required Simply Extend can advise you on this process and put you in touch with one of our certified party wall surveyors.</p>
	       </div>
	       <div class="col-md-6 question block">
	          <h3>If we decide to use the Simply Extend architectural service, how long does it take to get plans drawn up?</h3>
	          <p>On average it takes us between 4 – 5 weeks from signing the contract to get our client to agree on a set of plans, but of course we have had faster approvals if a client is in a particular hurry.</p>

	       <div class="col-md-6 question block">
	          <h3>How long does it take for a set of plans to be approved for my extension?</h3>
	          <p>In general it takes 8 weeks for plans to be approved through planning permission.  However, not all extension projects require planning permission – see our question and section on permitted development.</p>
	       </div>
	       <div class="col-md-6 question block">
	          <h3>What is permitted development and can I build my extension under this process?</h3>
	          <p>If your property is not in a conservation area you may have permitted development rights (PD). This means you can build your extension without having to go through the planning permission process.</p>
	       </div>

	       <div class="col-md-6 question block">
	          <h3>What is the difference between permitted development rights and planning permission for extensions?</h3>
	          <p>With planning permission you are asking the council if your proposed scheme is acceptable. It is open to rejection by them and/or your neighbours and will have to follow the local development plan. With permitted development you are asking the council to simply confirm that your scheme fits within the permitted development criteria. The council will issue you a Lawful Development Letter if they agree. Technically you are not required to have the Lawful Development letter in place before the work starts and in fact there is no law stating you have to have it. This allows clients who request it, to start the work without waiting for the Lawful Development Letter thus saving time.</p>
	       </div>
	       <div class="col-md-6 question block">
	          <h3>What different types of extensions can I build on my property?</h3>
	          <p>There are many different types of extensions that can be added to your property such as rear kitchen extensions, side return extensions and even double storey extensions.</p>
	       </div>

	          <h3>How much disruption should I expect throughout the build phase of an extension?</h3>
	          <p>There is no doubt that building work can at times be disruptive and slightly stressful, after all we completely altering your home! However there are certain tips and measures that can be taken to ease this process.  If budget allows, you may decide the best way to avoid the disruption is to move out throughout the construction phase.  However we know at times this can be realistic.  Other steps are to build temporary kitchens to enable you to still cook and clean, or to build stud partitions to block out the dust from the rest of your home.  Always remember to pack away any valuables or anything that could potentially be damaged as materials and equipment will be making their way through your home.</p>

	       <div class="col-md-6 question block">
	          <h3>How much does a home extension cost?</h3>
	          <p>This can vary depending on the size and spec of the extension you require.  For more ideas visit our cost page.</p>

	          <h3>I’ve had a site survey, how long will it take to receive my quotation?</h3>
	          <p>Once a Simply Extend surveyor has visited your property and carried out a site survey it will take no longer than 1 week for you to receive a comprehensive quotation.  If you have not received your quotation in this time, then please visit your junk email folder (as sometimes  our quotations can end up by accident there!) or give our team a call on +44 20 7099 8689.</p>

	       <div class="col-md-6 question block">
	          <h3>How long are your quotations valid for?</h3>
	          <p>Unfortunately from time to time our rates have to be reviewed due to increasing prices of materials.  Our quotations are therefore valid for 6 months.</p>

	          <h3>Do you build loft conversions?</h3>
	          <p>Yes.  We have a specialist loft conversion arm to our business called Simply Loft.  We have many clients that use us to carry out a loft conversion and an extension at the same time, thus saving hassle and cost by avoiding having two separate contractors.</p>

	          <h3>Can I have other refurbishment work carried out to my home at the same time as my extension?</h3>
	          <p>Yes.  Quite often, we carry out refurbishment work to bedrooms, living rooms, bathrooms and downstairs toilets and utility rooms.  Please enquire for prices on your site survey.</p>
